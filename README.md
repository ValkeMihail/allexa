# Description


I developed this custom project using Firebase and React to create an online portfolio dedicated to a certain photographer. The app offers an interactive and aesthetic experience, presenting visitors with a select collection of photos through an engaging slideshow. The project also includes pages for contact and personal description.

Users can explore the photo display page and enjoy an immersive visual experience through the interactive slideshow, which displays the photos in a pleasant and attractive way. They also have access to the contact page to establish contact with the photographer. The personal description page provides relevant information about the photographer's experience, photographic style, and more.

As a photographer, this project provides a personalized control panel through which you can manage and update portfolio photos, personal description, and even your own profile photo. This functionality allows for personalization and optimization of the portfolio.
